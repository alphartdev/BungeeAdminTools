# --- Lookup ---
# Player lookup - aims at providing a quick view of a player's situation
# This message is really big (a lookup is multiline), therefore placeholders aren't {0}, {1} ...
# The placeholder may refer to others translation message, e.g the {connection_state} placeholder can be
# the connection_state_online or connection_state_offline placeholder depending if the player is online or not
# but more intuitive words.
# The {last_comments:number} is configurable, just set number to whatever number you want
# Formatting tools :
# '\n' to make a new line --> will appear ingame
# '\' to be able to use multiple lines in this FILE will have no impact InGame
# '¤' will be replaced by space InGame, needed for spaces at the beginning of a line
