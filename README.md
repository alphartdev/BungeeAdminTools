## For developers

### Importing the project
BAT is a maven project so most dependencies will be automatically downloaded once you import it. However don't forget to add BungeePerms in your lib folder (because there is no maven repo available).

### About pull requests
I'm very glad if you send PR, however I need you test to really test them before please :)

If you want to write unit test, go ahead but please don't mix unit tests with integration tests
