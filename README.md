Plugin page : http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungee-admin-tools.444/
Repository webinterface : https://github.com/alphartdev/BAT-WebInterface/

## For developpers :

### Importing the project :
BAT is a maven project so most dependencies will be automatically downloaded once you import it. However don't forget to add BungeePerms in your lib folder (because there is no maven repo available).

### About pull requests :
I'm very glad if you send PR, however I need you test to really test them before please :) 
If you want to write unit test, go ahead but please don't mix unit tests with integration tests
